			<p class="Text"><span class="Text---trailhead-name">Vicinity North:</span> Directions begin at the intersection of PA268 and Kittanning Hollow Rd. To reach this point from Pittsburgh, go northeast on PA28. At the PA28/US422 interchange, follow US422 west in the direction of W. Kittanning. After looping around the interchange, take the exit for PA268. Follow PA268 north for about 12 miles to Kittanning Hollow Rd. Turn right/north on Kittanning Hollow Rd.</p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="Text---trailhead-name">Catfish (access to northern unconnected segment) trailhead:</span> From vicinity north (intersection of PA268 and Kittanning Hollow Rd) turn right/north on Kittanning Hollow Rd and go 3.4 miles to PA68. Turn right/east on PA68. Follow PA68 about 2.8 miles, across the Allegheny River, into East Brady. PA68 is called Kellys Way and turns left/southeast as Third St in East Brady. After the left turn on 3rd St, continue following PA68 for 3.8 miles, climbing the knob around which Bradys Bend bends, to Sarah Furnace Rd/SR3006. Turn left/west on Sarah Furnace Rd and descend almost 2 miles. Where the road reaches the river, and makes a right turn to follow the river upstream, park on the left. From the parking area follow the road to the left/southeast about 1000 feet down to the old railroad grade. From here the closed tunnel entrance is another 0.9 miles to the left (downstream); a sharp right (upstream) provides about 4 miles of rough trail. </p>
